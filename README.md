# Migraine - Unfuck Your Brain

### A language that compiles down to [Brainfuck][1]

Migraine will eventually be a complete programming language. I created this project for learning purposes only. It is still a work in progress, and it is not very high on
my priority list. I plan to give it some more love in the near future.

## What currently works

For the moment, Migraine is simply an expression evaluator. It supports the following operations :

- Add ( + )
- Unary and binary minus ( - )
- Multiply ( * )
- Divide ( / )
- Exponent ( ^ )
- Grouping operations with parenthesis

## Next on the todo list

- Variable assignment
- Boolean logic and operators
- Custom Brainfuck interpreter (which will use numbers instead of ASCII characters)
