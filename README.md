# Migraine - Unfuck Your Brain

### A set of projects related to [Brainfuck][1]

##What is it / What will it be

Migraine is a Brainfuck interpreter, debugger and will eventually consist of a 
complete programming language that compiles down to Brainfuck. I created this project for 
learning purposes only. It is still a work in progress.

## What currently works

#### Expression Evaluator
- Add ( + )
- Unary and binary minus ( - )
- Multiply ( * )
- Divide ( / )
- Exponent ( ^ )
- Grouping operations with parenthesis

#### Brainfuck Interpreter and Debugger
- Fully functional interpreter (uses ints instead of chars, I plan to make this configurable)

## Next on the todo list (in no particular order)

- Variable assignment
- Boolean logic and operators
- Unit test the hell out of the Interpreter
- Brainfuck Debugger which will support breakpoints and step-by-step execution, plus displaying and editing of the memory cells
